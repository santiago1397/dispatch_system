"""Operator job-rejection detector.

When a job lands in a source chat (WhatsApp company group or Quo), the
operator may decline it by replying — within the next two operator
messages — with a short phrase ("pass", "have it", "i have it",
"<zip> pass", "cant take") or by re-pasting the job body with a small
note at the bottom. When that happens the parent ``Job`` is transitioned
to the terminal ``rejected`` status so the alert engine never flags it as
stuck/unclosed (it will never be dispatched).

This module holds only the *pure* signal detection — matching a reply
body (optionally against the job it follows) to a reject signal. The
orchestration (finding the target job, enforcing the two-operator-message
window, and running the lifecycle transition) lives in
``WhatsappService._maybe_reject_job``.

The phrase list is intentionally a module constant rather than a DB
setting: the vocabulary is small and stable, and keeping it in code keeps
the hot ingest path allocation-free. Promote it to ``app_settings`` only
if operators need to edit it without a deploy.
